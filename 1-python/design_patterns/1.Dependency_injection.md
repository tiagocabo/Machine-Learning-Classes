# Design Patterns
## What is Dependency Injection?
**Dependency Injection (DI)** is a design pattern used in software development to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. In simpler terms, **Dependency Injection** is a technique where an object receives its dependencies (the objects it works with) from an external source rather than creating them itself.

## Why Use Dependency Injection?
**Decoupling**: It helps in reducing the coupling between classes. This means that classes do not need to know about the concrete implementations of the dependencies they use, making the system more modular and flexible.

**Ease of Testing**: It makes unit testing easier by allowing you to inject mock dependencies into a class, rather than relying on real objects that may have complex behaviors.

**Scalability and Maintenance**: It simplifies the process of changing dependencies. If you need to change the way a dependency behaves, you can simply inject a different implementation without modifying the dependent class.

### How Dependency Injection Works
In Dependency Injection, the dependencies are provided to a class in one of the following ways:

1. **Constructor Injection**: Dependencies are provided through a class constructor.
2. **Setter Injection**: Dependencies are provided through setter methods.
3. **Interface Injection**: The dependency provides an injector method that will inject the dependency into any client passed to it. This is less common.

### Examples of Dependency Injection
1. **Constructor Injection**
In this method, dependencies are provided to the class through its constructor.
```python
class Engine:
    def start(self):
        return "Engine started"

class Car:
    def __init__(self, engine: Engine):
        self.engine = engine

    def drive(self):
        return self.engine.start()

# Dependency injection
engine = Engine()
car = Car(engine)
print(car.drive())  # Output: Engine started
```
**Explanation**:

Here, the Car class does not create an Engine object by itself. Instead, the Engine is provided (injected) to the Car through its constructor.

2. **Setter Injection**
In this method, dependencies are provided through setter methods.
```python
class Engine:
    def start(self):
        return "Engine started"

class Car:
    def __init__(self):
        self.engine = None

    def set_engine(self, engine: Engine):
        self.engine = engine

    def drive(self):
        if self.engine is not None:
            return self.engine.start()
        else:
            return "No engine found"

# Dependency injection
engine = Engine()
car = Car()
car.set_engine(engine)  # Inject the dependency using setter
print(car.drive())  # Output: Engine started

```
**Explanation:**
-Here, the `Car` class has a method `set_engine()` to set its `Engine` dependency. This provides more flexibility as the engine can be changed after the `Car` object is created.

3. **Interface Injection (Less Common)**
In this method, the dependency provides an interface to inject itself into a client.

```python
class Engine:
    def start(self):
        return "Engine started"

class Car:
    def __init__(self):
        self.engine = None

    def inject_engine(self, engine: Engine):
        self.engine = engine

    def drive(self):
        if self.engine is not None:
            return self.engine.start()
        else:
            return "No engine found"

# Interface injection
engine = Engine()
car = Car()
engine.inject_engine(car)  # Inject engine into car
print(car.drive())  # Output: Engine started

```

**Explanation:**
Here, the `Engine` class could provide a method that injects itself into the `Car`. This approach is less common and is often replaced by Constructor or Setter Injection.

**Summary**
**Dependency Injectio**n is a powerful technique for decoupling classes and their dependencies, making your code more modular, flexible, and easier to maintain. By externalizing the creation and management of dependencies, Dependency Injection also facilitates better testing practices, particularly in unit testing, by allowing dependencies to be easily replaced with mocks or stubs.
