# Factory Pattern
The **Factory Pattern** is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a super class, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. Instead of instantiating objects directly with a constructor, the Factory Pattern delegates the responsibility of object creation to a factory method.

**Why Use the Factory Pattern?**
- **Encapsulation**: It encapsulates the object creation process, which can be complex and require many configurations.
- **Loose Coupling:** It promotes loose coupling by decoupling the client code from the specific classes that are instantiated.
- **Flexibility:** It makes the system more flexible by allowing the introduction of new types of objects without changing the existing code.

## Types of Factory Patterns
**1. Simple Factory** (not a formal design pattern but commonly used):
A single method creates objects of different types based on input.

**2. Factory Method:**
A method in a base class or interface is overridden in subclasses to create specific types of objects.

**3. Abstract Factory:**
A super-factory used to create other factories. Each factory in the abstract factory is responsible for creating a family of related objects.

## Example of the Factory Method Pattern
**Problem Without Factory Pattern**
Consider a situation where you need to create different types of transportation objects like Car, Bike, and Truck. Without a factory, you might instantiate these classes directly:
```python
class Car:
    def drive(self):
        return "Driving a car"

class Bike:
    def drive(self):
        return "Riding a bike"

class Truck:
    def drive(self):
        return "Driving a truck"

# Without Factory Pattern
car = Car()
bike = Bike()
truck = Truck()

print(car.drive())  # Output: Driving a car
print(bike.drive())  # Output: Riding a bike
print(truck.drive())  # Output: Driving a truck

```
**Problem:** If you need to add new types of vehicles, you must modify the client code. This tightly couples the client code to the specific vehicle classes.

**Implementing the Factory Method Pattern**
To decouple the client from the specific classes, you can introduce a factory method:

```python
class VehicleFactory:
    def create_vehicle(self, vehicle_type):
        if vehicle_type == "car":
            return Car()
        elif vehicle_type == "bike":
            return Bike()
        elif vehicle_type == "truck":
            return Truck()
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unknown vehicle type")

class Car:
    def drive(self):
        return "Driving a car"

class Bike:
    def drive(self):
        return "Riding a bike"

class Truck:
    def drive(self):
        return "Driving a truck"

# With Factory Pattern
factory = VehicleFactory()

car = factory.create_vehicle("car")
bike = factory.create_vehicle("bike")
truck = factory.create_vehicle("truck")

print(car.drive())  # Output: Driving a car
print(bike.drive())  # Output: Riding a bike
print(truck.drive())  # Output: Driving a truck

```

***Explanation:***

- The `VehicleFactory` class encapsulates the logic of creating different types of vehicles.
- The client code no longer needs to know the specific classes that are instantiated, making it easier to extend or modify.

## Example of Abstract Factory Pattern
For more complex scenarios, the Abstract Factory Pattern can be used to create families of related objects.

```python
class Car:
    def drive(self):
        return "Driving a car"

class Bike:
    def drive(self):
        return "Riding a bike"

class Truck:
    def drive(self):
        return "Driving a truck"

class ElectricCar(Car):
    def drive(self):
        return "Driving an electric car"

class ElectricBike(Bike):
    def drive(self):
        return "Riding an electric bike"

class ElectricTruck(Truck):
    def drive(self):
        return "Driving an electric truck"

class VehicleFactory:
    def create_car(self):
        return Car()

    def create_bike(self):
        return Bike()

    def create_truck(self):
        return Truck()

class ElectricVehicleFactory(VehicleFactory):
    def create_car(self):
        return ElectricCar()

    def create_bike(self):
        return ElectricBike()

    def create_truck(self):
        return ElectricTruck()

# Using the Abstract Factory Pattern
def client_code(factory: VehicleFactory):
    car = factory.create_car()
    bike = factory.create_bike()
    truck = factory.create_truck()

    print(car.drive())
    print(bike.drive())
    print(truck.drive())

# Regular vehicles
factory = VehicleFactory()
client_code(factory)
# Output:
# Driving a car
# Riding a bike
# Driving a truck

# Electric vehicles
electric_factory = ElectricVehicleFactory()
client_code(electric_factory)
# Output:
# Driving an electric car
# Riding an electric bike
# Driving an electric truck

```

**Explanation:**

- The `VehicleFactory` creates standard vehicles, while the `ElectricVehicleFactory` creates electric versions of those vehicles.
- The client code can work with any factory that follows the `VehicleFactory` interface, allowing it to create a family of related objects.

## Summary
The Factory Pattern provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. It helps in decoupling the client code from the object creation process, making the system more modular, scalable, and easier to maintain. There are different variations of the Factory Pattern, including the Simple Factory, Factory Method, and Abstract Factory, each serving different needs in software design.
