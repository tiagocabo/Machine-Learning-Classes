Here are some ways to import modules in Python:\n","\n","\n","\n","1.   Importing a module:\n","\n","  To import a module in Python, you can use the import statement followed by the name of the module. For example, to import the math module, you can use the following code:\n","```python\n","import math\n","```\n","\n","  Once the module is imported, you can use its functions, classes, and variables by prefixing them with the module name, followed by a dot. For example:\n","\n","  ```python\n","  import math\n","\n","  x = math.sqrt(4)\n","  print(x)  # Output: 2.0\n","  ```\n","\n","\n","2.   Importing specific functions or classes from a module:\n","\n","  If you only need specific functions or classes from a module, you can import them directly using the from keyword. For example:\n","\n","  ```python\n","  from math import sqrt\n","\n","  x = sqrt(4)\n","  print(x)  # Output: 2.0\n","  ```\n","In this case, you don't need to prefix the function with the module name.\n","\n","\n","3. Importing a module with an alias:\n","\n","  You can also import a module with an alias, using the as keyword. This can be useful if you want to use a shorter or more convenient name for the module. For example:\n","```python\n","import math as m\n","x = m.sqrt(4)\n","print(x)  # Output: 2.0\n","```\n","\n","\n","4. Importing all functions and classes from a module:\n","\n","  If you want to import all functions and classes from a module, you can use the * symbol. For example:\n","\n","  ```python\n","  from math import *\n","\n","  x = sqrt(4)\n","  print(x)  # Output: 2.0\n","```\n","\n","In this case, all functions and classes from the math module are imported, so you can use them directly without prefixing them with the module name.
