It is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python and is used widely in data science, machine learning, and other fields that involve numerical computations.\n","\n","NumPy provides a set of powerful tools for working with arrays, including functions for mathematical, logical, and statistical operations, and tools for manipulating arrays in a variety of ways. It also includes a number of algorithms for performing linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and random number generation.\n","\n","One of the key benefits of NumPy is its performance. It is implemented in C and provides a fast and efficient interface to numerical routines, making it well-suited for large-scale numerical computations. It also integrates well with other Python libraries, such as SciPy and Matplotlib, which makes it a powerful tool for scientific computing and data analysis."],"metadata":{"id":"Hb2VzicyXVGS"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install numpy"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":0},"id":"HZm5Am3GivIS","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1679089699866,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":7287,"user":{"displayName":"Tiago Cabo","userId":"15696869764367982150"}},"outputId":"46938fc5-2bd3-4667-9cc5-4b63c1faac6f"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Looking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://us-python.pkg.dev/colab-wheels/public/simple/\n","Requirement already satisfied: numpy in /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages (1.22.4)\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# How to use?\n","\n","1.
