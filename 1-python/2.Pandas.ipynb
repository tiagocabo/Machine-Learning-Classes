It is built on top of NumPy, another popular library for numerical computing in Python. Pandas provides high-level data structures like DataFrames and Series that are designed to handle tabular and labeled data.\n","\n","DataFrames are two-dimensional arrays with rows and columns, where each column can have a different data type. They are similar to spreadsheets or SQL tables. Series are one-dimensional arrays that can hold any data type, and they are similar to columns in a DataFrame.\n","\n","Pandas provides a wide range of functions for data manipulation, including filtering, sorting, grouping, and merging. It can handle missing data, time series data, and categorical data.
