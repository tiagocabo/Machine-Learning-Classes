# Python Data Structures

## 1. Lists
- **Definition**: A list is an ordered, mutable (changeable) collection of elements. Lists can contain items of different types, including other lists.
- **Syntax:**
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
- **Properties:**
- **Mutable:** You can modify a list by adding, removing, or changing elements.
- **Ordered:** Elements are maintained in the order they are added.
- **Indexed:** You can access elements by their index (e.g., `my_list[0]` for the first element).
- **Duplicates Allowed:** Lists can contain duplicate elements.

- **Example:**
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)  # Adds 4 to the end of the list
my_list[1] = 5  # Changes the second element to 5
```

## 2. Tuples
- **Definition**: A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of elements. Like lists, tuples can hold elements of different types.
- **Syntax:**
```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```
- **Properties:**
- **Imutable:** Once a tuple is created, it cannot be modified.
- **Ordered:** Elements are maintained in the order they are added.
- **Indexed:** You can access elements by their index
- **Duplicates Allowed:** Tuples can contain duplicate elements.

- **Example:**
```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
# my_tuple[1] = 5  # This would raise an error since tuples are immutable
```

- ***When to Use:*** Tuples are used when you need a collection of elements that should not change. They are often used for returning multiple values from a function or grouping related data together.

## 3. Dictionaries
- **Definition:** A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each key must be unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples), while values can be of any type and can be mutable.
- **Syntax:**
```python
my_dict = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
```

- **Properties:**
    - **Mutable:** You can modify, add, or remove key-value pairs.
    - **Ordered** (Python 3.7+): Dictionaries maintain the order of insertion.
    - **Keyed:** Accessed by keys rather than index.

- **Example:**
```python
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25}
my_dict['age'] = 26  # Updates the value associated with the 'age' key
```

## 4. Sets
- **Definition:** A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are useful for membership tests and eliminating duplicate entries.
- **Syntax:**
```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```
- **Properties:**

    - **Mutable:** Elements can be added or removed.
    - **Unordered:** Elements do not have a specific order.
    - **Unique Elements:** Duplicates are automatically removed.

- **Examples:**
```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
my_set.add(4)  # Adds 4 to the set
my_set.add(3)  # Does nothing since 3 is already in the set
```
- **When to Use:** Sets are ideal for situations where you need to eliminate duplicates or perform mathematical set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

- ## 5. Frozensets
- **Definition:** A frozenset is an immutable version of a set. Once created, the elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.
- **Syntax:**
```python
my_frozenset = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```
- **Properties:**
    - **Immutable:** Cannot be modified after creation.
    - **Unordered:** No specific order.
    - **Unique Elements:** Only unique elements are allowed.

- Example:
```python
my_frozenset = frozenset([1, 2, 3])
# my_frozenset.add(4)  # This would raise an error since frozensets are immutable
```
- **When to Use:** Frozensets are useful when you need a set-like collection that should not change, often used as dictionary keys or elements of other sets.

## 6. Strings
- **Definition:** A string is an immutable sequence of characters. Strings are used to store and manipulate text.
- **Syntax:**
```python
my_string = "Hello, World!"
```

- **Properties:**

    - **Immutable:** Once created, the string cannot be modified.
    - **Indexed:** Characters can be accessed by index.
    - **Iterable:** You can iterate over each character in the string.

- **Example:**
```python
my_string = "Hello"
new_string = my_string + " World"  # Concatenation

```
- **When to Use:** Strings are used for text manipulation and are immutable to ensure data integrity.
