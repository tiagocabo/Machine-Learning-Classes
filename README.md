## ðŸ”§ Getting Started
### **Installation**
To set up the environment, install dependencies using `pipenv`:
```sh
pip install pipenv  # Install pipenv if not already installed
pipenv install  # Install dependencies
pipenv shell  # Activate virtual environment
```

### **Running Jupyter Notebooks**
Launch Jupyter Notebook to interact with the materials:
```sh
jupyter notebook
```

### **Dataset Usage**
Several datasets such as Titanic, Credit Card Fraud, Housing Prices, and Twitter Sentiment are included in their respective sections.
